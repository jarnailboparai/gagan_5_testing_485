  <h2>Install WordPress</h2><p><br></p><p>Let Me Start by Saying Installing Wordpress is as easy as a one button installation. Afew Years ago this was a more complex task. Now, Over 90% of WebHosting Companies have a one button install button for Wordpress.</p><p>Most of the Below Info will NOT be needed but I included it for those who want more detailed descriptions on your blog and setting it up.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/I0xPZdr.jpg" width="600"><br></p><p><br></p><strong><a name="requirements">Requirements:</a></strong>
<p>To run WordPress your host just needs a couple of things:</p> 

<ul><li><a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> version 4.3 or greater</li><li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> version 4.1.2 or greater</li></ul> 



<strong><a name="database">Create a Database</a></strong><br>
You can usually do this in your hosting control panel. If you aren't 
sure how to do this, ask your hosting company.  After you have set it 
up, you should have 4 pieces of information about the database.<br>
1. <b>Database Name</b> - The name of your database.<br>
2. <b>Username</b> - your database user name.<br>
3. <b>Password</b> - Your database password.<br>
4. <b>Host name</b> - This is going to be a host name.  It  might be something like mysql.mydomain.com, or just localhost.
<p>Without these 4 things, you won't be able to set up WordPress.  
Again, contact your hosting company's tech support if you have any 
trouble with this.</p>

<p><strong><a name="download">Download the current version of WordPress.</a></strong><br>
This is easy.  Just go to <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">wordpress.org/download/</a>,
 and download the current version.  You have a choice between the ZIP 
file or the TAR.GZ file.  I think the TAR.GZ file may be smaller, but I 
always download the ZIP.<br>
<strong>Uncompress the WordPress ZIP file.</strong><br>
Again this is easy.</p>


<p><strong><a name="wp-config">Configure WordPress</a></strong><br>
Open the WordPress folder and rename the file <strong>wp-config-sample.php</strong> to just <strong>wp-config.php</strong>.  Now open it and insert the 4 pieces of information about your database into the 4 fields below.</p>
<p>Change:</p>
<blockquote><p>
define('DB_NAME', 'database_name_here');    // The name of the database<br>
define('DB_USER', 'username_here');     // Your MySQL username<br>
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here'); // ... and password<br>
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');    // 99% chance you won't need to change this value</p></blockquote>



<p>to</p>
<blockquote><p>define('DB_NAME', 'yourDatabaseName');    // The name of the database<br>
define('DB_USER', 'your-username');     // Your MySQL username<br>
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your-password'); // ... and password<br>

define('DB_HOST', 'your-hostname');    // 99% chance you won't need to change this value</p></blockquote>




<p><strong><a name="upload">Choose Your Install Directory and Upload Everything</a></strong><br>
If you want your WordPress blog in a separate directory of your website,
 like “yourdomain.com/blog”, then rename the “wordpress” folder to 
“blog” and upload it to the root directory with an ftp program.</p>

<p>If you want your blog to be in the root directory of your site, 
meaning the blog will be located at “yourdomain.com”, then just open the
 wordpress folder and upload all the files and folders into your web 
root.  If you already have a file called index.html, or index.php, 
you'll need to rename it or get rid of it before you uploading 
everything.</p>


<p><strong><a name="install">Finish and Install</a></strong><br>

</p><p>8. In a browser, go to the domain where you uploaded WordPress, 
and then to /wp-admin/install.php, and follow the simple directions 
there.</p>
<p>You will be given a username and password.  Save it in a safe place.</p>
<p>That's it.  You now have a new blog. You can now log in with your username and password, and start writing.</p>





<p><strong>Download a WordPress theme</strong><br>
This is the fun part.  Picking a WordPress theme. There are many places to find <a href="http://howtostartablog.org/wordpress-themes.html">WordPress Themes</a>. When you find one you like, just download it and unzip it just like you did with the WordPress ZIP file.</p>
