Most fairways are jealously guarded by gorse and broom, adding an additional challenge to members and visitors alike.<br><br>The 517 yard 4th par 5 has recently been changed to a dogleg by selective tree planting. Many new bunkers have recently been added and the course lengthened.&nbsp; A new pond or water retention area has also been constructed in front of the 6th tee.&nbsp;<br><br>Having played the spectacular 12th with its green nestling in the Clashach Cove over 100 feet below the tee, golfers are faced with panoramic views over the Moray Firth.&nbsp; Paul Lawrie described this hole as probably the best par 3 he has ever played. Many golfers standing on this tee have seen the local dolphins having fun in the firth below.<br><br>The bloom on the gorse and broom during the summer months is an added attraction throughout the course.</font></p><p style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px 20px 0px 0px; float: left; font-family: arial, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><font color="#000033">Golfers Information:<br>Visitors are especially welcome although booking at weekends is recommended.
