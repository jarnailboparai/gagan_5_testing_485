    Varsity ft. Travis Garland & Justin Bieber - The Right Time 2011

Varsity Ft. Travis Garland & Justin Bieber -- The Right Time Lyrics:

you say you should be my girl,
that sounds good,
but i got a girl that i can mess and be honest to,
ooh, i could never break her heart,
i'd be a fool to be playing her,
shes been with me from the start,

you and me, we act like bonnie & clyde,
we go hard with it, and i know we're two of a kind,
no one else could compare,
got me in deep six feet addicted to this feeling,
in another time, another space, you could be my girl,

god this feelings so sweet,
sometimes its never the right time, to fall,
you could be so perfect for me,
sometimes its never the right time, to fall,
sometimes its never the right time,

to fall in love with you,
sometimes its never the right time, to fall in love with me
sometimes its never the right time, to fall in love with you,
sometimes its never the right time, to fall in love with me,
eh,

our chemistry is insane,
i never found nothing like this before, baby,
your just like one of my boys,
keep getting hot, but i'm feeling you,
until i don't know what to do,

you and me, we act like bonnie & clyde,
we go hard with it, and i know we're two of a kind,
no one else could compare,
got me in deep six feet addicted to this feeling,
in another time, another space, you could be my girl,

god this feelings so sweet,
sometimes its never the right time, to fall,
you could be so perfect for me,
sometimes its never the right time, to fall,
sometimes its never the right time,

to fall in love with you,
sometimes its never the right time, to fall in love with me
sometimes its never the right time, to fall in love with you,
sometimes its never the right time, to fall in love with me,
eh,

i never saw it coming,
it really hit me hard, girl
but next time around, i'll be coming back for you,
who would believe that you've always been my dream girl,
but next time around, i'll be coming back for you,

god this feelings so sweet,
sometimes its never the right time, to fall,
you could be so perfect for me,
sometimes its never the right time, to fall,
sometimes its never the right time,

to fall in love with you,
sometimes its never the right time, to fall in love with me
sometimes its never the right time, to fall in love with you,
sometimes its never the right time, to fall in love with me,
