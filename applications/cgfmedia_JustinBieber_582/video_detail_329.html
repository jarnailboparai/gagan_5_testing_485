Favorite Girl

I always knew you were the best 
The coolest girl I know 
So prettier than all the rest 
The star of my show 
So many times I wished you'd be the one for me 
I never knew you'd get like this girl what you do to me 

Youre who I'm thinking of, 
Girl you aint my runner up 
No matter what you're always number one 

My prized possession 
One and only 
I adore ya 
Girl I want ya 
The one I can't live without that's you , that's you 
You're my special 
little lady 
The one that makes me crazy 
Of all the girls I've ever known its you, its you 

My favorite, my favorite, my favorite, my favorite girl, my favorite girl 

Youre used to going out your way to impress these mr. wrongs. 
But you can be yourself for me, I'll take you as you are 
I know they said believe in love is a dream that can't be real 
So girl lets write a fairytale
And show them how it feels 

Your who I'm thinking of, 
And girl you aint my runner up, 
No matter what you're always number one 

My prized possession 
One and only 
I adore ya 
Girl I want ya 
The one I cant live without, thats you, thats you
You're my precious 
little lady 
The one that makes me crazy 
Of all the girls I've ever known it's you, it's you 

My favorite, my favorite, my favorite 
My favorite girl , my favorite girl 
My favorite, my favorite, my favorite 
My favorite girl , my favorite girl

You take my breath away, 
With everything you say 
I just wanna be with you 
My baby , my baby, oh oh, 
My miss don't play no games, 
treats you no other way than you deserve cause you're the girl of my dreams 

My prized possession 
One and only 
Adore ya 
Girl I want ya 
The one I can't live without that's you , that's you, 
You're my special little lady 
The one that makes me crazy 
Of all the girls I've ever known it's you, it's you 

My prized possession 
One and only 
Adore ya 
Girl I want ya 
The one I can't live without that's you , that's you, 
You're my special little lady 
The one that makes me crazy 
Of all the girls I've ever known it's you, it's you
