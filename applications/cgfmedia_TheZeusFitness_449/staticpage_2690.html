  Everyone wants a flat stomach.
 Not only will clothes fit better, but come summer time, you’ll proudly 
wear that swimsuit rather than hiding your gut under a shirt. The 
problem is the road to a flatter stomach is not an easy one. If you want
 a flat stomach, here are a few exercises to help you get that elusive 
six-pack.
<h2><font color="#CC0099" size="4">Cardio</font></h2>
<p>Jogging and running can help you get those abs. The more cardio you 
do, more fat will be burned and since fat is the only thing standing 
between you and your flat stomach, you need to get rid of it. According 
to some, sprinting also helps out. These bursts of speed and high 
intensity workouts will help. Riding a bike also helps.</p>
<h2><font color="#990000" size="4">Abdominal Exercises</font></h2>
<ol><li>Full sit-up. This is the traditional way to get abs. You just need 
to lie on the floor and then raise your legs until your knees are high 
up with your feet still flat on the floor. Pull yourself up and hold the
 position for a second before going back down.</li><li>Crunches. If the full sit-up is hard, a crunch can be just as 
effective. It’s for less flexible people, because you won’t have to pull
 your whole upper body up. Just raising your back a few inches off the 
ground is enough. Make sure you contact your abs as you do a rep to get 
the best results.</li><li>Lying Side Crunch. Position yourself as you would when doing 
crunches, but this time, put both your legs to the side. Raise your back
 a few inches off the floor while working your abs and that’s a rep.</li><li>Core Exercises</li></ol>
<p>A stronger core will lead to a flat stomach. The Rectus Abdominis is a core muscle that when defined, makes your six-pack.</p>
<ol><li>Planks. Lie down face down on the floor, then prop yourself up with 
your elbows and toes. Keep your body parallel to the ground and hold it 
until you can’t hold it any more.</li><li>Side Plank. Lie to your side and again prop yourself up with your 
elbow and the side of your feet. Hold this position for a minute and do 
it again on the other side.</li></ol>
<p>Getting abs is not easy. But once you get it and you take your shirt off in the beach or beside the pool, that confidence in your body and how it looks is priceless. Let’s not forget the look and compliments you’ll get from other people as well.</p>
