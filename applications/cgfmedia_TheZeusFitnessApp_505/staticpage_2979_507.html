  The best workouts for woman would be those which promote the proper 
combination of<img alt="" src="http://www.zeusfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/woman-after-workout-at-home-300x199.jpeg" align="right"> diet and exercise as a change in lifestyle. Many of the 
programs and workouts available for women today tend to target one thing
 or another. If a woman’s goal is to gain muscle then her workout would 
be different from an individual whose goal is to lose weight. <br><br>In terms 
of overall health, the best workout for women should include a healthy 
nutritious diet consisting of fresh fruits and vegetables along with 
cardio at least three times a week and some form of weight 
training/resistance twice a week. This would be the ideal workout for 
women as each of these three will help to promote a lifestyle of healthy
 eating and exercising that will allow you to reach whatever fitness 
goals you are striving for. Just running on a tread mill for several 
hours a day may burn off some excess fat however you could make better 
use of your time by incorporating some resistance training into your 
routine.
<p>Here are some basic exercises that you can do that will help to work out more than one muscle group at a time.</p>
<ul><li>shoulder press</li><li>dumbbell bench press</li><li>pull-ups</li><li>bicep curls</li><li>squats</li></ul>
<p>Although some of these exercises may sound like they will bulk you 
up, it is the amount of repetitions and how heavy the weights are that 
will determine whether you tone the muscle or increase its size. If you 
are not trying to gain muscle then you should not train to muscle 
failure. By stopping short of muscle failure you will develop a more 
slender and lean look while also maintaining your femininity with a bit 
of muscularity. There is no one training routine that is the absolute 
winner when it comes to workouts for women. It is important to remember 
that you have to work out according to what your fitness goals are and 
the look that you are seeking. What you see another individual doing may
 not work for you as that person may have different goals than yours.</p>
<p>Remember it doesn’t matter how much weight you may be trying to lose,
 there are three simple changes that you need to make to facilitate your
 weight loss. Although the dieting and fitness industry may have you 
believe differently by trying to convince you to try many of the new fad
 diets that on the market or the latest pill that will have you 
“shedding” calories in no time at all. The basic principles of losing 
weight will always be the most effective way to lose and maintain weight
 loss. A healthy nutritious diet, cardio training and weight resistance 
training are three simple steps you need to incorporate into your 
lifestyle that will have you losing weight before you know it.</p>
