7 Killer Ab Moves You've Never Heard Of:

#1 The Power Wheel: While seated, strap your feet to the power wheel (or to your roller blades). Turn over into a plank position, supporting your weight on your hands and feet (via the wheel).

Maintaining good posture, pull your feet toward your hands.

#2 Dragon Flags:Lay flat on your back in a spot where you can reach back to grab something that anchors you. Keeping your torso rigid, raise your legs and hips up until you're on your shoulder blades, feet pointing straight up.

#3 Dumbbell Farmer's Walk: Take a dumbbell or other heavy object in one hand.

Stand as straight as you can, begin walking, and hold the weight on one side. Turn around and come back.

Top 10 Ab Exercises by Marcus Ingelmo:

1: Russian Twists

Loaded Russian twists, performed for 10 reps per side. Hold a weight with both arms for resistance. Twist your torso to the right side until your arms are parallel with the floor.

Move back to the starting position and then move to the opposite side.

2: Kettlebell Windmills

The kettlebell windmill is a great compound exercise with some much-needed rotation, just like the Russian twist. Clean-and-press the kettlebell overhead while rotating your wrist.

Bend your hip to one side. Slowly lean until can touch the floor with your free hand. The kettlebell should be held over your head at all times.

Reverse the motion and repeat.

3: Hanging Leg Raises

The hanging leg raise is another great ab exercise. Hanging from a chin-up bar, raise your legs until your legs and torso from a 90-degree angle.

I usually do this exercise with a little twist, rotating my legs side to side. More work, greater reward.

4: Gorilla Chin/Crunch

The gorilla chin/crunch is kind of similar to the hanging leg raise but still a bit different--that's why it's another stand-alone exercise. Here, hang from a chin-up bar with an underhand grip.

Bend your knees to a 90-degree angle and pull yourself up while crunching.

Finish the crunch when your nose reaches the same level as the bar.

Top 10 Most Effective Ab Exercises by Paige Waehner, About.com Guide

"Want to know the most effective ab exercises? The American Council on Exercise found out just which exercises target the abs in the most effective way in an ACE-commissioned study.

It's important to remember that, while ab exercises won't get rid of fat from the belly, a strong core is important for keeping your body healthy and protecting your spine.

The most effective ab exercises start with the bicycle, which is the best move for targeting the rectus abdominis (i.e., the 'six pack') and the obliques (the waist), according to the study.

Most Effective Ab Exercise: Bicycle

-Lie face up on your mat and place your hands behind your head, lightly supporting it with your fingers.

-Bring the knees in to the chest and lift the shoulder blades off the floor without pulling on the neck.

-Rotate to the left, bringing the right elbow towards the left knee as you straighten the other leg.

-Switch sides, bringing the left elbow towards the right knee.

-Continue alternating sides in a 'pedaling' motion for 1-3 sets of 12-16 reps."
