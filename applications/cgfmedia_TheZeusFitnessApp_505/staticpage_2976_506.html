  What many people don’t realize is that the world of fitness does not 
revolve around a one-size-fits-all mentality.&nbsp; What works for one person
 may not wor<img alt="" src="http://www.zeusfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/workout-300x199.jpeg" align="right">omeone else. Everyone’s body will not respond in the 
same manner to the different exercises being introduced to it. For this 
reason it is hard to say what the best workouts for men are. A workout 
designed for men should incorporate some key factors that promote a 
balanced diet, cardio training as well as weight resistance/training.<br><br>
<p>The next factors that must be taken to into consideration are the 
goals of the individual that is working out. Depending on what the 
fitness goals of the individual is this will determine which exercises 
will be used. If a man is trying to put on 20 pounds of solid muscle he 
would not be doing a lot of exercises that, tear down, lengthen or 
otherwise tone muscles down. This would be in contradiction to what his 
fitness goals are. On the other hand with a man attempting to lose 20 
pounds and increase his endurance would not spend his time lifting heavy
 weights. No one group of exercises or exercise routine is effective for
 everyone unless everyone has the same fitness goals.</p>
<p>Some exercise programs will help you achieve a lean and long figure 
while others may be designed to increase your mass. It is important that
 we realize there are different techniques that incorporate the best 
exercises for men. There are techniques or exercises that will lead to a
 lean long figure, while others will increase muscle mass. It is 
important to understand that there are many techniques that make up the 
best exercises for men, which will help you to attain your desired look 
desire while also helping to strengthen your body.</p>
<h2>Aerobic Activity</h2>
<p>Aerobic activity for men should be conducted 30 min per session. 
Males burn fat and build muscle differently from women and long sessions
 of aerobic activity are not recommended for building muscle and burning
 fat.</p>
<h2>Resistance/Strength/Weight Training</h2>
<p>Strength training the large muscles of the body such as the back, 
chest muscles and hamstrings is one of the best ways for men to increase
 their muscle tone and size. Some of these exercises include bench 
presses, squats and military presses.<br>
Overall blending these two activities into one workout routine along 
with a sensible diet will help you achieve your fitness goals. The best 
workouts for men are those which stress the importance of healthy eating
 along with regular exercise or physical activity.</p>
