If I could tell anyone with low self esteem/confidence one thing and for them to believe it, it would be this....

You...Are..More!!!! 

Of course you would probably dismiss that straight away, or maybe you would smile in false acceptance and then secretly dismiss it. but, it so true. You are so much more. Believe it = make it real!

My intention for this piece is to musically invoke a confident strong self belief feeling in all who listen to it. If I succeed for just one person then I am happy.
