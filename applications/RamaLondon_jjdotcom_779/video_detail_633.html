What makes you happy? lots of things, right? New gadgets, finding money in your pockets, going 

on holiday, the girl of your dreams saying yes to a date with you? Nope. You do! You make you happy, no one else, no thing else, how can they without your permission?

What makes you sad? Just as many things? insurlts from other people, rejection, losing your job? certain events can be overwhelming of course, and you might not feel top of the world whilst these events are new and raw, but ultimately it is you that determines whether you feel happy or not. Choose to be happy. It is a skill, but like any skill it can be accomplished with practice.
 Whether you believe this or not isn't it worth trying? I mean...what if it works? Wow! 

I had fun making this one, I hope you enjoy it too.
