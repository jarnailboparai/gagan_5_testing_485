<p><strong>Berries</strong> - Summer to Fall</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p><strong><img style="border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; width: 100px; height: 85px; float: right;" alt="Huckleberry" src="http://www.doomsday-survival.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/red-huckleberries.jpg"></strong></p>

<em><strong>6 - Cattails &nbsp;</strong></em> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img style="border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; width: 114px; height: 125px; float: right;" alt="Cattails" src="http://www.doomsday-survival.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Cattail.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Young Shoots and Stalks</strong> - Early Spring</p>

<p><strong>Roots</strong> - Any time summer through Winter</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Simply put the cattail is like the jack of all trades, it has many qualities and uses&nbsp;and is considered the grocery store of the wilderness. It is hardy, has a plethora of edibles and other excellent survival uses.</p>

<p>It is easy to spot and is abundant. It has long or tall stiff stalks, long sword like leaves and a thick&nbsp;brown seed top shaped like a hot dog and nearly the same in length. They can reach heights of over 8 feet. In the spring time it will sprout&nbsp; 2 flower heads, one above the other with the one at the top being the male and the bottom a female.&nbsp;The male as it grows will turn into a tan or light brown&nbsp;pollen cluster while the lower female will turn into the recognizable dark brown fuzzy seed top.</p>

<p><strong>Locale:</strong></p>

<p>The cattail can be found all over north America and Canada and will be&nbsp;located easily&nbsp;in swampy type of wetland areas, edges of ponds and lakes. Almost anywhere there is standing water you will find cattails.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Edibles: </strong></p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the cattail is a&nbsp;wilderness grocery store&nbsp;and is edible year around. In spring time the younger shoots and stalks can be peeled or stripped and can be eaten either raw or by boiling. During late spring the flower heads or seed tops can be stripped down and boiled to eat. The pollen heads, which form in early summer can be picked and eaten raw or dried and ground in to flour. In&nbsp;late summer all the way through winter the roots can be collected and eaten. They are found at the base of the plant and look like horn shaped sprouts, can be eaten raw or&nbsp;boiled. The root stalk can also be gathered and then&nbsp;ground or crushed, placed in water and dissolved&nbsp;in to flour after it is drained and dry. It contains large amounts of starch.</p>
