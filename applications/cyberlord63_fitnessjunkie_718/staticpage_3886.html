  <font size="5">Eat a wide range of foods to&nbsp;ensure that you’re getting a balanced diet 
and that your body is receiving&nbsp;all the nutrients it needs.</font><br><h3>Eat lots of fruit and veg </h3>
It’s recommended that we eat at least five portions of different 
types of fruit and veg a day. It’s easier than it sounds. A glass of 
100% unsweetened fruit juice can count as one portion, and vegetables 
cooked into dishes also count. Why not chop a banana over your breakfast
 cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for some dried fruit?<br><h3>Eat more fish</h3>
<p>Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and 
minerals. Aim to eat at least two portions a week, including at least 
one portion of oily fish. Oily fish is high in omega-3 fats, which may 
help to&nbsp;prevent heart disease.&nbsp;You can choose from fresh, frozen and 
canned: but remember that canned and smoked fish can be high in salt.</p>
<p>Oily fish include salmon, mackerel, trout, herring, fresh tuna, 
sardines and pilchards. Non-oily fish include haddock, plaice, coley, 
cod, tinned tuna, skate and hake. Anyone who regularly eats a lot of 
fish should try to choose as wide a variety as possible. <br></p><h3>Cut down on saturated fat and sugar</h3>
<p>We all need some fat in our diet. But it’s important to pay attention
 to the amount and type of fat we’re eating. There are two main types of
 fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much saturated fat can increase the
 amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of 
developing heart disease.</p>
<p>Saturated fat is found in many foods, such as hard cheese,&nbsp;cakes, 
biscuits, sausages, cream, butter, lard and pies. Try to cut down, and 
choose foods that contain unsaturated rather than saturated fats, such 
as vegetable oils, oily fish and avocados.</p>
<p>For a healthier choice, use a just a small amount of vegetable oil or
 reduced-fat spread instead of butter, lard or ghee. When you're having 
meat, choose lean cuts and cut off any visible fat.&nbsp;Learn more, and get 
tips on cutting down,&nbsp;in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/Eat-less-saturated-fat.aspx">Eat less saturated fat</a>.</p>
<p>Most people eat and drink too much sugar. Sugary foods and 
drinks, including&nbsp;alcoholic drinks,&nbsp;are often high in energy (measured 
in kilojoules or&nbsp;calories), and could&nbsp;contribute to weight gain. They 
can also cause tooth decay, especially if eaten between meals.</p>
<p>Cut down on sugary fizzy drinks, alcoholic drinks,&nbsp;cakes, biscuits 
and pastries, which contain added sugars: this is the kind of sugar we 
should be cutting down on rather than sugars that are found naturally in
 foods such as fruit and milk.</p>
<p>Food labels can help: use them to check how much sugar foods contain.
 More than 22.5g of sugar per 100g means that the food is high in sugar.
 Learn more in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/sugars.aspx">Sugars</a> and <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/pages/food-labelling.aspx">Understanding food labels</a>. <br></p><h3>Get active and be a healthy weight</h3>
Eating a healthy, balanced diet plays an essential role in 
maintaining a healthy weight, which is an important part of overall good
 health. Being overweight or obese can lead to health conditions such as
 type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, heart disease and stroke. Being 
underweight could also affect your health.&nbsp; Physical activity can help you to maintain weight loss or be&nbsp;a healthy 
weight. Being active doesn’t have to mean hours at the gym: you can find
 ways to fit more activity into your daily life. For example, try 
getting off the bus one stop early on the way home from work, and 
walking. Being physically active may help reduce the risk of heart 
disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes.<br><h3>Don't get thirsty</h3>
We need to drink about 1.2 litres of fluid every day to stop us 
getting dehydrated.&nbsp;This is in addition to the fluid we get from the 
food we eat.&nbsp;All non-alcoholic drinks count, but water, milk and fruit 
juices are the most healthy.&nbsp;Try to avoid sugary soft and fizzy drinks 
that are high in added sugars and can be high in calories and bad for 
teeth. When the weather is warm, or when we get active, we may need 
more.<br><h3>Don’t skip breakfast</h3>
<p>Some people skip breakfast because they think it will help them lose 
weight. In fact, research shows that eating breakfast can help people 
control their weight. A healthy breakfast is an important part of a 
balanced diet, and provides some of the vitamins and minerals we need 
for good health. Wholemeal cereal, with fruit sliced over the top is a 
tasty and nutritious breakfast. </p><br>
