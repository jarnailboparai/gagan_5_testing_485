  <p>The 4 core plant species that are mostly edible and available most anywhere and anytime are listed below. These 4 types of plants/trees will provide you with enough nutrients to keep you going in most survival situations at most any time of year.</p><p>Here they are:</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u><em>1 - Grasses</em></u></strong></p><p>Most all bladed grass is edible. The stem, blades, leaves, roots and seeds.</p><p>These can be meadow grass, oats, wheat and even bamboo. They are high in nutrients, vitamins and minerals. </p><p>Blades or young shoots of grasses can be eaten raw. Mature grass is much more dense in fiber and contain large amounts of cellulose and can be very difficult to digest which is why it is recommended to just chew the grass thoroughly, then swallow the nutrient rich juices, then spit out the chewed up material.</p><p>You can also boil the grasses, dried or green to make nutrient rich tea.</p><p>99% of grass seed can be used to eat raw, boiled or ground into a flour mixture. Seed is very high in protein. There are a few types of grass seed that may be toxic if eaten raw so it is recommended to dry roast them if you are not sure as a safety precaution. </p><p>The best way to identify good seeds or non-toxic is to make sure they are either green or brown. Any dark seeds like black, dark chocolate brown or purplish in color may be toxic.</p><p>&nbsp; </p><p><strong><u><em>2 - Cattails</em></u></strong></p><p>The cattail is one of those plants that is or could be considered by most to be the survival plant of all plants. It is&nbsp; a hardy plant and has many edible parts and also can be used for other survival uses like fire starter and arrow shaft material.</p><p>It is more than abundant and found almost everywhere there is swamp, wetland, standing water or moisture. It has long blades, long stems and rigid stalks with a furry&nbsp; or brown fuzzy top that resembles a hot dog but dark brown in color. they can reach lengths or a height of up to 7-8 feet.</p><p>The edibles:<br>In early spring the the stalks and younger shoots can be peeled back and eaten raw and or boiled. in late spring the green flower head can be peeled or husked like corn and boiled.</p><p>Early to mid summer the pollen tops can be eaten raw and or dried and ground into flour. The roots are also very edible and can be used during late summer through the winter. Eating them raw or boiling the portion that is horn like shaped in the root cluster. They are high in starch and can be crushed or ground into a flour after being dried.</p><p>It is 99% edible all year around and also has some major medicinal qualities. The ripe flowers can be ground into a salve for abrasions and minor cuts. The sticky resin or juice from around the leaves can be used as a styptic, antiseptic and anaestetic for discomfort or pain including a numbing agent for a bad tooth when rubbed on the gums of the infected area.</p><p>The brown seed heads make an excellent fire starter or tinder and can also be used for insulation from the cold. The stalks can be used for arrow shafts and the blades can be used for making/weaving baskets or other items. </p><p><br></p><p><br><strong><u><em>3 -&nbsp;Pine Trees</em></u></strong></p><p>Pine trees are another one of an abundant source for survival. The pine tree is a multi branched tree and it can be as tall as 100 ft or more and is found all over north america.</p><p>The edible portions are the needles, pollen anthers, mature cone seeds. The pitch can be used for fire starter and at times be used for an adhesive or glue.</p><p>You can strip and chop up the needles from young branches and can then boil them for 5 minutes and use for a tea. The needles are very high in vitamin C. The pollen anthers can be eaten raw and are also very high in protien. </p><p>The cone seeds are like a nut and can be harvested from mature cones by placing the cone next to a fire, heating them to open them up which makes it easier to exposing the seeds.</p><p>The needles and young branches can also be used for thatching,&nbsp; insulation and bedding for your survival hut.</p><p><br></p><p><br><strong><u><em>4 -&nbsp;Acorns</em></u></strong></p><p>Acorns are a product of the Oak tree and abundant in most portions of north america.</p><p>Acorns are a nut and edible year around and are very high in nutrients if they are prepared correctly. The nutrition in a cup of acorns is equivalent to good steak.</p><p>White and Pin oak acorns can be eaten raw even in green state, all other types must be boiled and or leached with many changes of water to remove the bitterness. The leached or boiled water from the acorns can be used as an antiseptic for cuts, bruises, abrasions and sore throats (do not swallow, use as gargle for sore throat).</p><p><br></p>
