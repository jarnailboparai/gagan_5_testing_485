    <div class="video_title">DR OZ 3 DAY DETOX LUNCH SMOOTHIE DRINK by The Blender Babes</div>

    <div class="video_desc">

    Print Recipe & Meet the Babes here! http://www.blenderbabes.com/?p=4107

This green smoothie drink by Dr. Oz. is the lunch drink used in his 3 day detox cleanse. With this lunch drink Dr. Oz says that as your bloating begins to subside, this drink will begin to replenish your body by packing in 5 essential greens.  We love the flavor of this detox smoothie (it's refreshing and tastes a bit like sweet grass) and that it gives us essential omega's AND keeps us from getting hungry by including good-for-you healthy fats from the coconut oil.  Make sure to keep the skin on the cucumber, it's the healthiest part which we learned from Dr Oz years ago! Just be sure to clean it with a special was to remove pesticides and such if you don't buy an organic cucumber.  We recommend making fresh almond milk for this 3 day detox, as it will give you much needed healthy fats, calories, and nutrition over store bought brands. This was a the favorite of our Blender Babes models who tried Dr Oz 3 day detox before our How To video shoot!  The Blender Babes use the commercial blenders Blendtec and Vitamix for all their blender recipes, you can get more fiber than a juicer by mixing in whole vegetables and you get a resort quality texture.  Don't forget to give us a good blender review and share this video with your friends.
