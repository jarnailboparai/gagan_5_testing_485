  Smoothies are one of the easiest ways to pump vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other nutrients into your body to keep it working effectively. The health benefits of this one change to your diet are undeniable. As an aid for weight loss, drinking smoothies a definite bonus. You don't need any more convincing. You are ready to get started making smoothies.<br><br>But, there’s one problem – the uncertainty of knowing if there are any special pieces of equipment needed to make your smoothies.<br><br>While there isn’t anything special, outside of a basic blender, deciding which blender is the best choice can be a bit of a challenge. There are so many different options and so many different price points. Let’s take a look and compare the less expensive blenders to the blenders with a higher price tag. <br><br><b>Less Expensive Blenders </b><br><br>If you’re a newbie to the smoothie revolution, you may want to start with a cheaper blender so you can find out if making smoothies on a regular basis will be a good fit for you and your diet. With that said, there is a problem with the less expensive standard kitchen model; they aren't made for such heavy-duty use.<br><br>Making a smoothie out of a banana, some milk, and a few strawberries won't wear out a standard blender. However, when you expand your smoothie horizon to include lots of fresh fruit, berries, vegetables, and other ingredients, that little blender is going to have to work hard to puree those ingredients. Then, when you get hooked on your smoothies and start making them every day, you’re going to run into more problems. Chances are your blender will wear out, break, and need to be replaced, over and over again.<br><br>With the less expensive blenders there is another problem. They don’t often get your smoothie, well, smooth. The motors don't have enough horsepower, so they don’t have the capability of making a puree out of solid foods, like some fruits, berries, and vegetables. That smooth consistency requires a big motor and blade, very often lacking on a cheaper model.<br><br><b>More Expensive Blenders </b><br><br>One of the biggest reasons to consider buying a more expensive blender is they have high powered motors that are built to handle frozen and raw food. These specialized blenders can puree even the crunchiest fruits and veggies in seconds. They are built to create a smooth consistency with very little effort.<br><br>An obvious drawback to the more expensive blenders is the price. Any specialty blender with this kind of power is going to have a high price tag. Of course, there is also a price range within this category of blenders, so shop around. If counter space is part of your decision, some of these expensive blenders can be rather big, but not all. Again, shop around and you'll find a variety of sizes, even single serving styles with just as much power as the big blenders.<br><br>While it might be hard to justify spending a large chunk of money on a higher quality blender, in the long run it's usually worth it. The motor and blade are made to last. Spending more upfront may actually save you money because you won’t have to keep replacing a less expensive model. You may feel more confident with an expensive blender since they often have a warranty.<br><br><b>One More Thing...</b><br><br>Remember, you are not looking for a juicer. You are looking for a blender that produces a smoothie. You want to drink the entire fruit, berry, or vegetable - not just the juice from it. You don't want to throw away any of the food you are processing. You want all the nutrients and fiber you can get in your smoothie.<br><br>While this article doesn’t even begin to cover all the different blenders available, the information should give you a basic idea of what will be a better choice for you. Be sure to do your homework as there are new options on the market almost daily. You'll find just about as many options for blenders as there are recipes for smoothies! So, shop around and enjoy adding healthy smoothies to your diet soon.<br>
