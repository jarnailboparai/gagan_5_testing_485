Labor radicals Tom Mooney and warren Billings were accused of the crime. However, a photograph showed Mooney and his wife on top of a building at 975 Market Street with the clock visible on the street. According to the</div><div>time on the clock, Mooney could not have made his way through the crowd to set the bomb off, thus establishing his alibi. The clock was moved to Vallejo in 1932.</div><div><br></div><div><b>332 Georgia Street</b></div><div>The Central Bank, later Bank of America, and finally West America Bank, used this building since its construction in 1923.
